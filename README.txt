Introduction
============

Implements the roles tab for the GroupSpace content type of GrufSpaces.

The tab looks exactly like the Plone sharing tab, but stores the local roles
for users and groups in two attributes on the content type. The local roles
can then be assigned dynamically in the context of a GroupSpace using PAS.
